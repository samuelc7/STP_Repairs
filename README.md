# STP_Repairs
NodeJS project for STP_Repairs web app

# Overview
This project is for my friend who fixes phones and computers on the side. It will eventually allow for anyone living close to rexburg to be able to get in contact with him so that he can provide them services. 
This web app is built with NodeJS and currently only runs locally but will hopefully but up live and running soon.

I started this project to gain experience working with NodeJS and to provide an easy way for people in Rexburg to get in contact with my friend so then he could help them.

# Web Pages

As of right now there are 4 pages built for the web app
The first one is the Home page (index.ejs) which displays the welcoming page and allows users to get a feel for the website. There is artwork of a phone being repaired and then a button for users to be able to request repairs. There is also a section where the last repair made is shown with the customer review for it. 

There are also about us, contact us, and previous fixes pages that allow users to see more information about STP_Repairs. 

# Development Environment

I used VScode throughout this project.
I also used the Web Server for Chrome to host all of the images used in the web app. 

I used NodeJS, Html, and CSS for the site. I used the express module throughout the application.
